39293,Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two.

Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot.

MD informed me after this dose it becomes less effective for sleep, so why even bother.  15 years of trying different sleep medications and alternatives, and this, I can say for sure, was the LEAST effective I have ever come across.

I finally read some reviews on the copper IUD and depression and it seems pretty common. Drs will tell you it&#039;s not the IUD but please trust your intuition.

Overall pretty happy with results only negative aspect is the amount of time it takes for it to work.""",9,29-Feb-12,110
72195,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,"""I take it for gastrointestinal pain and it works fairly well. My pain often gets to the point of me wanting to punch everything in sight, and tramadol helps to quiet it. The only downsides are that it takes a little longer to start working than I need it to, since this unbearable pain can arise in a few minutes. Additionally, it causes constipation even in low doses, which can contribute to further gastrointestinal pain.""",9,31-May-14,20

The warts seemed to get bigger at the start but quickly vanished and now i have no visible warts at all! I used Warticon before and it did absolutely nothing, so i was thrilled to see something finally working. Give it time and patience. One word of advice,  i used this cream and got cryotherapy done around the same time. I would wait a week or so after cryo, apply the cream for a few weeks, then repeat of necessary. This seemed to really help.""",8,2-Nov-15,12

She was very good during the insertion about letting me know when pain would occur. It was very painful for about 3-4 hours. After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days. I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since.

Prior to taking Lisinopril my blood pressure was around 135/75.  As the amount of Lisinopril was increased my blood pressure kept increasing. After 40 days it was around 175/85 (maximum 200/100).

But, after being on it for 6 months now I&#039;m realizing that this pill is the reason for my poor mental health.  I went from being happy and satisfied with my life, to being an actual crazy person.  I started lashing out at the people I loved as the months progressed.

Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine.

On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.",,,,,,
"On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but, because of warnings about taste, I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste. Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. ",,,,,,
"On Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting. This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear. Also the emissions pretty much (though not entirely) finished by 8am, much quicker than the night before. I can only assume there was nothing left to eject.

But enskyce has made me bloated, retain water (take diuretics for this) and I had breakthrough bleeding at all different times of the month. Can&#039;t wait to finish off these last packs and swtich to something I like again, even if it costs more. Don&#039;t get Enskyce!""",1,10-Nov-16,2

About 6 months ago I stopped taking the pill and 3 months later I started it again. I had never had any problems with the pill before this but after stopping/starting the pill my hair started falling out. I have been to my OBGYN about it (who has taken me off of the pill), to my primary care physician, and to a dermatologist. All 3 doctors say there really isn&#039;t anything they can do about the hair loss. It&#039;s been about 5 months of hair loss and I am to the point my husband last night noticed my hair line is receding and I&#039;ve lost about 70% of my hair.

At first I noticed that my breast were very sore but within the past couple of days I haven&#039;t noticed it as much. I also know that I have one week left of this pack and I&#039;ve already started my period, as well as the cramping.  And I haven&#039;t been as hungry as usual.  I can live with all of these &quot;side effects&quot; as I guess you would call it.  But the one that I haven&#039;t gotten used to which happens to be the worst one for me and that is dizziness.  Its not an everyday thing but its happened twice now in 2 weeks, twice in a week. The first time it lasted for most of the day, the second time it was just in the morning.  I have a doctors appointment at the end of this week so we&#039;ll see.""",6,2-Sep-13,11

231087,Milnacipran,ibromyalgia,"""I have just weaned off Cymbalta and started Savella about 3 weeks ago. Be careful of your judgements on side effects of Savella.  Many of us are being weaned off medicines like Cymbalta and others and these can be causing the side effects. Coming off Cymbalta can cause dizziness, feeling &quot;weird&quot; and many others.  Before you write off Savella, make sure your side effects are not withdrawal from other medicines.  I have found if I take Savella on an empty stomach, I am nauseated, so take with food. I also have moved the second dose of the day to 2 pm and that helped decrease the insomnia.  I have more energy than before, but find I am a bit edgy at times and this is fading. Smaller doses may help side effects. Insurance should cover-ask for appeal if denied.""",8,27-Aug-09,109

When I got my iud placed they gave me a pill to help open up my cervix so it would be less painful. I was so terrified to get it done due to the horrifying reviews. I finally got up the courage to finally have the doctor do it. Ladies it was nothing! They put the clamp on my cervix which didn&#039;t feel great but it wasn&#039;t ungodly painful. The actual insertion took like 30 seconds and then it was done. I felt a cramp but not worse than the ones I get before I&#039;m about to start. After it was done I had mild cramping for an hour then nothing. I also had no spotting at all.

I know this caused it because it was the only thing I was taking and my doctor agrees with me.  He said it is a side effect of cholesterol medicines with some people. I would rather have my hair than low cholesterol. It is a gradual loss that takes a few months to show up. Afraid to try any other brands for fear they will do the same thing.""",8,1-Dec-09,9

I am on the one week prior to my period regime, due to PMDD. It is amazing already how calm and patient I am with my kids and husband. I had been on other meds in the past for depression, but hadn&#039;t taken anything in a few years. I have to say for the last post, the Yaz can make you depressed and gain weight. I would have just done the Zoloft. Loving the Zoloft. Excited to see how I feel when the side effects go away.""",7,5-Feb-12,52

I consider myself to have a pretty high pain tolerance, but this sent me for a loop. I got dizzy and clammy and almost passed out. Thankfully my best friend was with me and was able to talk me through it and drive my ass around for the day. The after cramps weren&#039;t unbearable, but still very uncomfortable. I only spotted for a few days afterwards. Last week was a breeze. I had no problems at all. Last night I started feeling cramping, like I was dreaming and could feel them in my dreams. I woke up this morning and the cramps were super intense. I got to work and too about 1,000 mg of ibuprofen because they were bad.""",5,27-Jun-16,3

My side effects were tender breasts &amp; mild cramps the week leading up to my period, and then I&#039;d get a headache on the day of my period, which was ok with me as it warns me it was coming. The plus side for me on this pill is my mood swings are gone. It really balances me out. Recently I went to the doctor for a check up, and she suggested a new birth control pill that will aloud me to only have 2 day periods verses the 4 day ones I have with Sprintec, but also, I wouldn&#039;t get the sore breasts, etc., plus it is a lower dose.

I&#039;m thankful that I haven&#039;t had the headaches, or dizziness.  I have been extremely tired and hoping that this will soon pass.

This continued on for the rest of the night. Today, I feel better, just a little abdominal cramping, but nothing that interferes with my day to day activities.

I&#039;ve probably have had it in for 20 mins now and it is just the worst!!!! I have only had a yeast infection one other time and my doctor prescribed me some prescription yeast infection cream. It never ever itched or felt this way! I never felt it, at all.
